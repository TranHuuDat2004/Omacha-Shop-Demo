## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML5
    *   CSS3
    *   JavaScript
    *   Bootstrap (Likely, based on UI elements)
    *   Tailwind 
*   **Backend:**
    *   PHP (Procedural or with a custom structure)
*   **Database:**
    *   MySQL (Managed via phpMyAdmin in XAMPP)
*   **Web Server:**
    *   Apache (via XAMPP)


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **XAMPP:** Download and install XAMPP (includes Apache, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, phpMyAdmin) from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Start XAMPP:**
    *   Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
    *   Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    *   Open your command line/terminal.
    *   Navigate to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows, or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS).
    *   Clone the project:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/TranHuuDat2004/Omacha_Shop.git
        cd OmachaShop
        ```

        The project should now be in a folder like `C:\xampp\htdocs\OmachaShop`.

3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    *   Create a new database:
        *   Click on "New" on the left sidebar.
        *   Enter the database name as `toy-shop`.
        *   Choose a collation (e.g., `utf8mb4_general_ci`) and click "Create".
    *   Import the SQL file:
        *   Select the newly created `toy-shop` database from the left sidebar.
        *   Click on the "Import" tab at the top.
        *   Click "Choose File" and navigate to the `OmachaShop/Frontend/` directory (or wherever `toy-shop.sql` is located within your project structure) and select the `toy-shop.sql` file.
        *   Scroll down and click "Go".

4.  **Configure Database Connection (if necessary):**
    *   Your PHP application will need to connect to the database. Locate the PHP file(s) in your project that handle database connections (e.g., `config.php`, `db_connect.php`, or similar).
    *   Ensure the connection details are correct for a default XAMPP setup:
        *   Hostname: `localhost`
        *   Database Name: `toy-shop`
        *   Username: `root`
        *   Password: `(empty by default)`
    *   *(If your connection file is structured differently, adjust accordingly.)*

5.  **Accessing the Application:**
    *   **Customer Site:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/OmachaShop/` (or `http://localhost/YourProjectFolderName/` if you named the folder differently in `htdocs`).
    *   **Admin Panel:** Access via `http://localhost/OmachaShop/admin/` (or the specific path to your admin area, e.g., `admin.php`, `admin_login.php`).
        *   Default admin credentials (if any, please specify): `Username: [admin_user]`, `Password: [admin_pass]` *(Update these if you have default credentials)*
